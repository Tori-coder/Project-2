**Quiz interface**

The quiz interface consists of an idiom and three buttons with alternative meanings. The user is instructed to choose the correct meaning of the idiom. On selection of one of the buttons, the user is informed if the meaning is correct or incorrect, and the score amended accordingly. Pressing the "next idiom" button loads the next idiom. 
There are ten idioms per quiz. At the end of the quiz, the user is informed and the "next idiom" button is replaced by a "start new quiz" button to start a new quiz.
